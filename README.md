# Ruby Recursion

This is a collection of functions I wrote that demonstrate the concept of [recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)). Examples include functions for:

* [merge-sorting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* deep duplication of an array
* finding the first n [Fibonacci numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_numbers) of an array
